            <h2 class="text-centered">About Me</h2>
            <h3>Background in Data</h3>
            <p>When I was in school, my favorite part of Marketing was numbers and data analytics. I
              got to see a lot of the front-end data translation and was always very curious about
              it.</p>
            <p>When I discovered Thinkful, I got to tap into that curiosity and explore it further
              each day now. I'm very excited to see where this road takes me.</p>
